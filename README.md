System Administration

'script' contains scripts that I run for extending a bare Ubuntu Server system
with a desktop if I want one, and the editor and other tools I usually use,
etc.

A particular script brings in programming tools and libraries, some of which
are necessary for working on projects based on Ruby on Rails.

The c? directories contain respectively representative "before" and "after"
versions of some system configuration files that may merit touching.  In each
case, the "before" version (in c0) might not exactly match what your system
has, but what to look at is the difference between my "before" and my "after"
version as a guide to what you might need to do to your config file.
