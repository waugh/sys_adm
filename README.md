System Administration

This contains scripts that I run for extending a bare Ubuntu Server system
with a desktop if I want one, and the editor and other tools I usually use,
etc.

A particular script brings in programming tools and libraries, some of which
are necessary for working on projects based on Ruby on Rails.
