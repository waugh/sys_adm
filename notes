If loading boinc, consider linking /var/lib/boinc-client to somewhere on the
big disk.

Skype and Dropbox have to be downloaded by browsing to their
respective web sites.  Remember to set whatever browser you use for this
purpose, to ask about download directory instead of defaulting to some place
you don't want it to.

You might want to touch /etc/hosts to point to anything in your network that has
a fixed local address (servers, routers, modems, etc.).
